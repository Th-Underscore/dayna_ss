  "0": "Start by describing the protagonist\u2019s immediate surroundings in greater detail, expanding upon the cafe setting. Detail the specific types of people present \u2013 business professionals, students, tourists \u2013 and their initial reactions to the tremor, contrasting their frozen fear with the protagonist\u2019s immediate assessment and preparation. Focus on sensory details: the smell of coffee mingling with the rising ozone, the clatter of dropped objects, the specific sounds of the fracturing streets.\n\nNext, narrate the protagonist\u2019s first confirmed kill of a Subterranean. Expand on the description of the creature \u2013 its size, the number and arrangement of its eyes, the texture of its skin, the specific sound of its shriek. Detail the impact of the tire iron, emphasizing the brutal efficiency of the strike. Avoid glorifying the violence, but portray it as a necessary act of survival.\n\nFollowing this, depict the protagonist\u2019s movement through the city as a calculated series of actions. Describe how they utilize the environment \u2013 broken debris, abandoned vehicles, narrow alleyways \u2013 to their advantage. Show, don\u2019t tell, their resourcefulness; for example, instead of saying \u201cthey were resourceful,\u201d describe them fashioning a weapon from a broken pipe. Include a brief internal monologue reflecting their unwavering focus on survival and their concern for their brother, Paul.\n\nThen, introduce a brief, fragmented radio transmission overheard by the protagonist. The transmission should be garbled and panicked, originating from a military source, confirming the widespread nature of the attacks and the complete breakdown of communication. The transmission should mention multiple cities under attack and a desperate plea for any survivors to report in. Keep the transmission short \u2013 no more than two sentences.\n\nAfter the transmission, have the protagonist encounter another survivor \u2013 a young woman, a medic, tending to the wounded. This encounter should be brief, consisting of minimal dialogue. The medic should offer the protagonist a limited supply of medical supplies, acknowledging their apparent competence. The protagonist should refuse, stating they are prioritizing reaching a secure location. This interaction should highlight the protagonist\u2019s self-reliance and pragmatic approach.\n\nFinally, conclude with the protagonist reaching a partially collapsed building, identifying it as a potential temporary shelter. End on a note of grim determination, emphasizing the long and arduous struggle ahead. The final response should be approximately 300-400 words.\n\nEnsure the response maintains a gritty, realistic tone, avoiding overly dramatic or fantastical elements. The focus should be on the protagonist\u2019s practical actions and internal state. Dialogue should be sparse and purposeful, primarily used to convey information or highlight character traits. Prioritize narration over direct speech.\n\nThe final response MUST NOT contain any formatting (no bold, no italics, no markdown, no bullet points, no headings, etc.). It must be plain text prose."
